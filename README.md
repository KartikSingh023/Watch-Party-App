# WATCH - PARTY
A real time messaging & video calling. 

Live Demo: https://watch-party-app.netlify.app/
A watch party app using Agora RTC (Real-Time Communication) provides a platform that allows users to watch movies, TV shows, or other video content together in real-time, no matter where they are located. The app could utilize the Agora RTC SDK to enable high-quality video and audio communication between users, as well as provide features such as text chat and screen sharing.

Users can create a room or join an existing one, and invite friends or others to watch content together.
The host of the room can choose a video from a list of supported sources (e.g. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, etc.), and start playing it. The video will be synchronized across all participants' screens.
Participants can chat with each other using a text chat feature, which could be integrated with the video player interface.
Participants can also share their screens, enabling them to show each other other content or websites while watching the video together.
The app could include other features, such as the ability to pause, rewind, or fast-forward the video, or to vote on what to watch next.
Using the Agora RTC SDK, the app could offer a seamless, real-time experience for users, with low latency and high-quality video and audio. Additionally, the app could be designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, with a clean and intuitive interface.
